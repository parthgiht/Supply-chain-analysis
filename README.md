# Supply-chain-analysis
## Overview
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of supply chain operations, focusing on key performance metrics and insights. By leveraging data analysis and visualization, the project aims to provide actionable insights into pricing strategies, product performance, cost distribution, and quality control across the supply chain.
## Libraries Used
The following Python libraries were used to perform data analysis and visualization:

1. **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
2. **numpy**: For numerical computations.
3. **matplotlib.pyplot**: For basic plotting and visualization.
4. **plotly.express**: For interactive visualizations.
5. **plotly.graph_objects**: For creating custom, advanced plots.
6. **plotly.io**: For configuring and customizing plotly templates.
7. **Default template**: plotly_white.

## How to Use
- Load the supply chain dataset into the project.
- Execute the scripts for each task to visualize and analyze the corresponding metrics.
- Interpret the visualizations and generated insights to enhance supply chain operations.

## Results
The project outputs include :
- Interactive and static visualizations for price-revenue relationships, product performance, cost distributions, and defect rate of product type & by mode of transportation.
- Quantitative metrics such as lead times, manufacturing costs, defect rates, and SKU-level details.
- Actionable recommendations based on analysis results.
