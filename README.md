## Overview📌
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of supply chain operations, focusing on key performance metrics and insights. By leveraging data analysis and visualization, the project aims to provide actionable insights into pricing strategies, product performance, cost distribution, quality control, and defect rate across the supply chain.
## Libraries Used🛠️
The following Python libraries were used to perform data analysis and visualization:

1. **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
2. **numpy**: For numerical computations.
3. **plotly.express**: For interactive visualizations.
4. **seaborn** : For creating statistical data visualizations.
5. **matplotlib** : For basic plotting and visualization.
6. **plotly.graph_objects**: For creating custom, advanced plots.
7. **plotly.io**: For configuring and customizing plotly templates.
8. **Default template**: plotly_white.

## Enviroment💻
- **Google Colab**: To implement the analysis and visualizations in a cloud-based environment.

## How to Use🚀
- 📥Load the supply chain dataset into the project.
- ▶️Execute the scripts for each task to visualize and analyze the corresponding metrics.
- 🔍Interpret the visualizations and generated insights to enhance supply chain operations.

## Results📊
The project outputs include :
- Interactive and static visualizations for price-revenue relationships, product performance, cost distributions, and defect rate of product type & by mode of transportation.
- Quantitative metrics such as lead times, manufacturing costs, defect rates, and SKU-level details.
- Actionable recommendations based on analysis results.

## Acknowledgments🙌
Special thanks to the libraries and tools that enabled efficient data analysis and visualization for this project.
